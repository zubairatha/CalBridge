slot extractor
- unable to have ranges with dates fix that.

absolute resolver 
- very huge (needs to be made much more concise and clearer)
- gets very confused with tomorrow/today due to examples.
- uses duration for calculating start and end time even when specific mentions are written. 
- i think the main issue lies with prompt being too huge.
- not extracting now
- its good with dates.
- if one try does not work, pls retry.
